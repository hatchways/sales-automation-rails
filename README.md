## Rails Sales Automation App

This project has two parts to it:

- a server folder that contains the back-end Rails app
- a client folder that contains the front-end React app (based on create-react-app)

To get the app running, run the client and server separately. The app should be able to talk to each other using the proxy setup in `client/package.json`.
